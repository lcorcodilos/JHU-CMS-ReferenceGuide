## For Contributors
Considering contributing? Great! To contribute, submit a PR changing the relevant LaTeX or submit an issue with a write up and someelse will drop it into the LaTeX for you.

Please adhere to the following LaTeX structure to keep everyting organized:
  * The only compiled .tex file is main.tex. It references all other tex files.
  * The tex files that are *not* main.tex are each their own section in the document and should not have any other sections within them (subsections and subsubsections are fine)
  * New section files may be necessary during early development. However, please consider finding a spot for your contribution in the current sections whenever possible. If you believe a new section is warranted, please submit an issue or PR so others can review and discuss.
