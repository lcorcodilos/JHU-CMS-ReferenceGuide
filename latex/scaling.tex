\section{Corrections, Weights, and Scaling}
This section covers different types of corrections, weights, re-weights, scaling, and other multiplicative factors required because of either differences in simulation and data or known inconsistencies in reconstruction algorithms that affect objects in both simulation and data. Each section briefly covers the reason for the corrections, how they are derived, and where to find the latest values and uncertainties.
