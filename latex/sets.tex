\subsection*{$t\bar{t}$ Simulation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For 2016, $t\bar{t}$ MC was generated for inclusive decays (meaning, all possible branchings of the two top quarks were allowed). For 2017 and 2018, decays were split into all-hadronic, semi-leptonic, and leptonic (denoted 2L2Nu).
\end{itemize}
